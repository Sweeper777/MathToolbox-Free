"helpText" = "<style>table td {border: black solid 1px;}</style><p><h1>Welcome to Math Toolbox!</h1> Here is how to use this app.</p><p>First, you need to select your intended operation from the operations list. Then in the operations screen, input the numbers and tap the Calculate button. The results will be shown accordingly.</p><p><h1>Example:</h1>You can select the \"Circle\" operation. You can then enter r (radius), d (diameter), A (Area), and P (Perimeter) into the corresponding blanks. You don't need to enter all of them. Let's say you only enter the radius. The app will automatically calculate all possible results involving your inputs. In this example, the results will show the diameter, the perimeter, and the area.</p><p>In case you don't understand what the input symbols mean, you can tap on the help button in the operation screen where a brief explanation will be shown.</p><p>If invalid inputs are detected, they will be ignored.</p><h1>Tips:</h1><p>You can click on a result and it will be automatically saved to the clipboard. This can be useful if you want to use the result in somewhere else.</p><p>When you enter a number, you can express it in scientific notation in the form of <br><pre>xey</pre> where x can be an integer or a decimal and y must be an integer. For example, 8e9, 1.234e5, -3.1e-9</p><p>You cannot express scientific notation like this:<br>1.234 × 10<sup5</sup></p><p>Please do not input any number that contains more than 17 digits (including decimal places). If this kind of input is detected, they/it will be truncated to 17 digits.</p><p>When you are inputting numbers for an operation, you can enter expressions instead of numbers, e.g. 5 * 5. You can also use the following constants and functions:</p><table><tr><td>Constant / Function</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>pi</td><td>The value of π</td></tr><tr><td>phi</td><td>The value of ϕ</td></tr><tr><td>e</td><td>The value of e</td></tr><tr><td>tau</td><td>The value of τ</td></tr><tr><td>sqrt2</td><td>The value of square root of 2</td></tr><tr><td>sqrt(x)</td><td>The square root of x</td></tr><tr><td>log(x)</td><td>The base 10 log of x</td></tr><tr><td>ln(x)</td><td>The base e log of x</td></tr><tr><td>exp(x)</td><td>The value e raised to power x</td></tr><tr><td>cos(x) sin(x) tan(x)</td><td>Trigonometric functions</td></tr><tr><td>acos(x) asin(x) atan(x)</td><td>Inverse of the trigonometric functions</td></tr><tr><td>csc(x) sec(x) cotan(x)</td><td>Reciprocals of the trigonometric functions</td></tr><tr><td>acsc(x) asec(x) acotan(x)</td><td>Inverse of the reciprocals of the trigonometric functions</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">And the hyperbolic variations!</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">And many more!</td></tr></table><p>Note: All the trigonometric functions use degrees as the angle measure.</p>";
