Then in the operations screen, input the numbers and tap the Calculate button. The results will be shown accordingly.</p><p><h1>Example:</h1>You can select the \"Circle\" operation. You can then enter r (radius), d (diameter), A (Area), and P (Perimeter) into the corresponding blanks. You don't need to enter all of them. Let's say you only enter the radius. The app will automatically calculate all possible results involving your inputs. In this example, the results will show the diameter, the perimeter, and the area.</p><p>In case you don't understand what the input symbols mean, you can tap on the help button in the operation screen where a brief explanation will be shown.</p><p>If invalid inputs are detected, they will be ignored.</p><h1>Tips:</h1><p>You can click on a result and it will be automatically saved to the clipboard. This can be useful if you want to use the result in somewhere else.</p><p>When you enter a number, you can express it in scientific notation in the form of <br><pre>xey</pre> where x can be an integer or a decimal and y must be an integer.
